    \textbf{Dataset Type} & \textbf{Prophet Performance} & \textbf{LSTM Performance} \\
    \hline
    No Trend, No Seasonality & Does not trend correctly, trends in the opposite direction & Follows trend but does not account for the noise well \\
    \hline
    Upwards Trend, No Seasonality & Steadily trends upwards but not according to the data (underfits) & Follows trend but predicts widely off values when accounting for noise \\
    \hline
    Downwards Trend, No Seasonality & Trends appropriately but underfits, does not recognize dataset intricacies & Recognizes trend and seasonality but produces very inaccurate values due to noise \\
    \hline
    Upwards Trend, With Seasonality & Recognizes trend but not seasonality & Recognizes trend and seasonality well, performs satisfactorily with test data \\
    \hline
    Downwards Trend, With Seasonality & Recognizes trend but not seasonality & Recognizes trend and seasonality but produces very inaccurate values due to noise \\
