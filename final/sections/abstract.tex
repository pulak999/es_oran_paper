    Mobile communication technologies, in their quest to deliver the highest possible data rates over the air interface, have nearly touched the Shannon limit. 
    Despite the advancements in techniques to enhance service capabilities, the power usage by the radio and compute components at the base stations (known as eNodeB in LTE and gNodeB in NR) frequently constitutes a significant part of the operational costs (OPEX) for operators, a factor that is commonly disregarded.
    This paper delves into one of the most straightforward strategies for energy conservation in cellular networks: deactivating under-utilized cells.
    While there has been extensive research in this field, we present a novel, statistics-driven, and machine learning-assisted Energy Saving (ES) solution for Radio Access Network (RAN) cell shutdown.
    In addition, we introduce a novel validation framework for evaluating decision-making effectiveness and ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) is maintained for end users.
    Our simulations, conducted over a O-RAN compliant rApp setup, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, resulting in a significant reduction in power consumption.
